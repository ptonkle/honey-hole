# Instructions for a coding agent in a Builder project

`AGENTS.md` holds the same rules for agents that read that file instead.

## Where code goes

1. Read `BRIEF.md`, `BUILDER-SPEC.md` and `GLOSSARY.md` before changing code.
2. The core (`crates/core`) owns every application decision and performs no input or output. Scripts and tools that need a rule read the core's output; they do not recompute it.
3. The shim (`crates/shim`) translates values and decides no application behaviour.
4. The page (`web/`) draws what the core returns and does not reproduce a core rule. The core describes the screen (`ui`) and takes settings, screens and flags through one function (`act`). Presentation numbers go in `data/*.json`; shaders go in `data/shaders/` and take rule values as uniforms.

## How to work

5. Run `cargo test` after each meaningful core change.
6. For each new behaviour test, add a row to `tests/breaks.json` and run `python3 scripts/break_tests.py`: the test must fail with its behaviour broken. Work expected values out by hand; never compare a value with the function under test. When a test needs a workaround to pass, the workaround is the finding: record it.
7. Keep `SECOND-ORDER.md` while you work: one row per assumption, surprise, divergence from the plan, or item the person must do, written when you notice it. It is how the person sees what you decided alone. A row that produced a rule names where the rule now lives; a row with status *person* is named in `HANDOFF.md`.
8. A scripted edit that replaces text asserts that it matched. A count in a document comes from `./scripts/count-tests.sh`.
9. Do not deploy unless `BRIEF.md`'s Autonomy paragraph says you may. Deploying is otherwise the person's decision (stage 8).
10. Before handoff, run `./scripts/check.sh` and record the result in `HANDOFF.md`.

## Words

11. Use each term in the sense `GLOSSARY.md` gives it, and never a word from its `Not:` line. A new term gets an entry before it appears in a string.
12. Reader-visible text follows `TONE.md`. A string that looks wrong is reported in `SECOND-ORDER.md`, not repaired. A string you write yourself is listed at the foot of `SECOND-ORDER.md` for the person to read. A list you generate that a reader will see (names, labels, word lists) is a worklist row for the person.

## Stopping

Write `PLAN.md` from the brief and stop until the person has read it, unless `BRIEF.md`'s Autonomy paragraph approves the plan in advance. When a rule in `BUILDER-SPEC.md` seems to block the work, stop and say so in a worklist row; do not loosen a check to make it pass. When a request is refused on safety grounds, leave the feature out and say so; do not reword the request to get past the refusal.
