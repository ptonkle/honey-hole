# Measurements

Stage 4, recorded by the agent before building and again at handoff. `B2 Require step-by-step justification`.

The state measured rather than recalled, so later changes can be compared with it. A probe prints numbers and asserts loose bounds at most; record its output here with the command that produced it.

| What | Command | Result | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Toolchain | `rustc --version; wasm-bindgen --version` | | |
| Core tests | `./scripts/count-tests.sh` | | |
| Full check | `./scripts/check.sh` | | |
| WebAssembly size | printed by `./scripts/build.sh` | | |
| Breaks caught | `python3 scripts/break_tests.py` | | |

## Not measured

Devices, browsers and conditions no measurement here covers.
